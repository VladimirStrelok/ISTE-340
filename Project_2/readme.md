jQuery web service
==================

What went above the requirements for this project is the tooltip.js plugin. This is a flexible tooltip plugin. It is customizable via css.
To get it working, you simply call .tooltip() on a jQuery object and send in the settings object. The two important properties are text and css.
text is the string that will be displayed. It can include html.
css is an object of css properties. It can override the default styles of the plugin.
